A scalable, user-focused MERN app.

Happily Ever Prints is a specialized platform dedicated to fulfilling wedding-related print needs. The goal is to empower users by providing them with intuitive tools to design their own wedding cards. With a text drag-and-drop design interface, users can easily customize pre-made templates, ensuring that their stationery reflects their unique style and wedding theme.

The platform offers a cost-effective alternative to hiring a professional designer. By utilizing our tools, users can create personalized and one-of-a-kind designs without the need for extensive design knowledge or experience. This not only saves them money but also allows them to take an active role in the creative process, resulting in a more meaningful and memorable wedding experience.

In addition to the design features, we also offer a convenient print-on-demand service. Users can order their completed designs to be professionally printed and delivered right to their doorstep. 

For future development, 
- More selection of card templates and more design options (like changing colors).

Libraries Used:
- React
- Express
- Mongoose
- Bcrypt
- GraphQL
- Apollo
- JWT, for authentication
- EmailJS
- Stripe, for payment
- Sass

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) 
- Clients should be able to view multiple templates for a variety of wedding stationary (invitations, menus, thank you cards, etcâ€¦)
- Client should be able to input text, choose specific information
- Once client is satisfied with their selection they should be able to add it to a cart (with quantity)
- Cart should display the items added, the quantity of each item, and then current total cost
- Once all items are in the cart client should be able to checkout and pay for all their items. (redirects them to stripe payment)
